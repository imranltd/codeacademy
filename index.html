Changes to your repository are called commits. You can imagine each commit as a snapshot of your repository at different times.

Time to create our first commit! In the first textbox, name your commit “Create index.html”. Commits usually start with a verb describing changes made to the repository.

Press the “Commit new file” button.

Viewing Your Website
Your website is now accessible at https://username.github.io! (Remember to replace username with your GitHub username.)

If you’d like, you can develop your website by adding more HTML and CSS! Your site should update a few minutes after each commit.

Troubleshooting
If your site isn’t appearing after 10 minutes, try these additional steps:

Within your username.github.io repo, go to Settings and scroll down to GitHub Pages. Under Source, make sure that your repo is linked to your web page. If you see None, then select the main branch.

Within the same GitHub Pages section, go to Theme Chooser and select any theme.
